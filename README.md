# Simple Webserver in C++

This example is for training purposes only and does not represent a complete web server for production.

Example of a simple C++ web server.


## Features

- This code creates a simple web server that listens for incoming connections on port 8080. When a request is received, it sends "Hello, World!" in response. This is an extremely simple example and does not include handling of many important aspects such as HTTP header parsing, flow management, and security. In a real environment, it is recommended to use more complex HTTP-enabled libraries such as Boost.Asio, Poco, or others to create a web server.
